# Security Audit Report

## Date: 2025-07-20

### ✅ Security Checks Performed

1. **API Key Security**
   - ✅ `.env.local` is properly gitignored
   - ✅ API keys are stored in environment variables
   - ✅ No hardcoded secrets found in codebase

2. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
   - ❌ Found 1 critical vulnerability in Next.js 14.0.4
   - ✅ Updated to Next.js 14.2.30 to fix the following:
     - Server-Side Request Forgery in Server Actions
     - Cache Poisoning vulnerability
     - DoS in image optimization
     - Authorization bypass vulnerability
     - Race condition cache poisoning
     - Information exposure in dev server

3. **API Endpoint Security**
   - ✅ API endpoint properly validates environment variables
   - ✅ Error messages don't expose sensitive information
   - ✅ Proper HTTP status codes used
   - ✅ Cache headers configured correctly

4. **XSS Protection**
   - ✅ No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage found
   - ✅ All user inputs are properly escaped
   - ✅ React's built-in XSS protection is active

5. **Environment Variable Handling**
   - ✅ Sensitive variables are server-side only
   - ✅ Proper validation before use
   - ✅ No client-side exposure of secrets

### 🔧 Actions Taken

1. Updated Next.js from 14.0.4 to 14.2.30
2. Updated eslint-config-next to match Next.js version
3. Verified all environment variables are properly secured

### 📋 Recommendations

1. **Run `npm install`** after the package.json update to install the secure version
2. **Regular Updates**: Set up automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot)
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting on the `/api/agents` endpoint
4. **CORS Policy**: Add explicit CORS headers if the API will be accessed from other domains
5. **Input Validation**: Add schema validation for API responses from Airtable
6. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for security events

### 🛡️ Additional Security Measures to Consider

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Add CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
2. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure the app is only served over HTTPS in production
3. **API Key Rotation**: Implement regular rotation of Airtable API keys
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure error messages in production don't expose stack traces

### ✅ Overall Security Status: GOOD

The application follows security best practices with proper secret management and no XSS vulnerabilities. The critical Next.js vulnerability has been addressed.
